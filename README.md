Early Detection Of Chronic Kidney Disease Using Machine Learning
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major medical problem and can be cured if treated in the early stages. Usually, people are not aware that medical tests we take for different purposes could contain valuable information concerning kidney diseases. Consequently, attributes of various medical tests are investigated to distinguish which attributes may contain helpful information about the disease. The information says that it helps us to measure the severity of the problem and we make use of such information to build a machine learning model that predicts Chronic Kidney Disease.

### Chronic Kidney Disease
Early chronic kidney disease has no signs or symptoms â€“ many people living with CKD donâ€™t even know it until the disease is in an advanced stage. About 10% of the adult population is living with some degree of CKD, and every year millions die prematurely from CKD and related complications.CKD is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, which are the primary cause of death for all people living with CKD. If CKD is detected early and managed appropriately, the deterioration in kidney function can be slowed or even stopped, and the risk of associated cardiovascular complications can be reduced. CKD is largely preventable, and can be detected early with simple blood and urine tests.
